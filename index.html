            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Susy Bando. You can Call Me a Food Lover but please do not call me a foodie. Your definition
                of foodie may be different than mine but in my mind, a foodie is pretentious about their food
                experiences and spends more time picking apart the pieces of a meal/dish rather than enjoying the
                moment.</p>
